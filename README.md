🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Terminal Size Too Small
Error: Terminal size must be at least 80x24
Solution: Resize terminal or use --width and --height arguments
Poor Performance
Symptoms: Low FPS, stuttering animation
Solutions:
- Use --preset lowend for resource-constrained systems
- Reduce --max-vehicles count
- Disable weather with --no-weather
- Use release build: cargo run --release
Unicode Characters Not Displaying
Symptoms: Broken box characters, missing symbols
Solutions:
- Use a modern terminal with Unicode support
- Set LANG=en_US.UTF-8 environment variable
- Try --ascii-style simple for basic ASCII only
Colors Not Working
Symptoms: No colors or wrong colors
Solutions:
- Ensure terminal supports ANSI colors
- Check TERM environment variable
- Use --enable-colors flag explicitly
